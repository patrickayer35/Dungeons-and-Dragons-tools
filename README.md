# Dungeons-and-Dragons-tools
### I built this tool for Dungeons and Dragons as a way to better manage battle encounters for my PCs. It randomizes monsters' HP for me, keeps track of all the spells being used, creates the initiative order, and keeps all the relevant details neat and orderly (all things I found messy when using just pencil and paper). However, it is not too user-friendly at the moment--some requirements when adding NPCs aren't clear or obvious, and there's a gross workaround required for uploading saved data from a previous session. And on top of that the tool itself looks like it was designed by someone who's never heard of CSS. But that will all be fixed later on down the road--right now, however, it works for me.
